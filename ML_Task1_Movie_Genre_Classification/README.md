# 🎬 Movie Genre Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie
based on its plot summary. It is a text classification problem solved using
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

This project is completed as Task 1 of the CodSoft Machine Learning Internship.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
1. Loaded and preprocessed the movie plot data
2. Converted text data into numerical features using TF-IDF
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
4. Trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier
5. Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification report
